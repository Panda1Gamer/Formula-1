            <p style="margin-left: 470;font-size: 25;position: absolute; top: 170px; right: 0px;display: grid;color: #ffffff;">The BRM P261, also known as the BRM P61 Mark II, is a Formula One motor racing car, designed and built by the British Racing Motors team in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England. The BRM P261 was introduced for the 1964 Formula One season, and its design was an evolution of Tony Rudd's one-off BRM P61 car of 1963. The P261 had a relatively long racing career; variants of the car were still being entered for Formula One World Championship Grands Prix as late as 1968. During the course of their front-line career, BRM P261s won six World Championship races, in the hands of works drivers Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart, and finished second in both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championship standings in 1964 and 1965. Stewart, Hill and Richard Attwood also used works P261s to compete in the Tasman Series in 1966. The BRMs dominated, with Stewart winning four, Hill two, and Attwood one of the 1966 Tasman Series' eight races. Stewart also won the title. The works-backed Reg Parnell Racing team returned in 1967 with Stewart and Attwood, where Stewart added another two wins to his tally. In terms of races won and total championship points scored, the P261 was the most successful car in BRM's history.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 470;font-size: 25;position: absolute; top: 1040px; right: 0px;display: grid;color: #ffffff;">The engine's internals remained almost unaltered from the Peter Berthon-designed unit which was installed in the V8 version of the P57, the BRM P578, with which Graham Hill had won the World Championship in 1962. BRM had experimented with a four-valve-per-cylinder version of the engine, but this was abandoned in favour of the tried and trusted, oversquare (68.5 x 50.8 mm), fuel-injected, two-valve, quad-cam configuration. The 1965 Formula One engine was rated at 210 bhp (157 kW) at 11,000 rpm, but was upgraded at Monza to 220 bhp (164 kW) at 11,750 rpm. In its Formula One form the engine had a capacity of 1,498 cc (91 cu in), but for the early 1966 Tasman Series races this was increased to 1,916 cc (116.9 cu in). In 1966 the Formula One upper engine size limit was raised from 1.5 to 3.0 litres, and the 1.9-litre Tasman unit was pressed into service for the World Championship as well. It was further uprated to 2.0 litres as the season progressed. For the P261's 1967 trip to the Antipodes the engine capacity was stretched yet further, providing the ultimate 2,136 cc (130.3 cu in) version, which also saw service in a few Formula One races later in the year. In an attempt to keep the P261 competitive into 1968, the fifth chassis was fitted with the new, 3-litre V12 BRM engine, but without success.</p>
